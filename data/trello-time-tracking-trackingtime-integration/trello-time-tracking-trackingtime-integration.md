# Trello Time Tracking (TrackingTime Integration)

## Description
A TrackingTime Power-Up for Trello that adds time tracking controls directly to Trello boards and cards, so teams can log work time as they manage tasks. Tracked time is sent to TrackingTime for automatic timesheets and analytics.

## Features
- **Time tracking inside Trello**: Log and manage work time directly from Trello cards.
- **Trello Power-Up integration**: Install the TrackingTime Power-Up to connect your Trello boards with TrackingTime.
- **Automatic timesheets**: Generate timesheets automatically from tracked time in Trello.
- **In-depth analytics**: Use TrackingTime’s reporting and analytics to analyze time usage and work processes.
- **Project and operations tracking**: Track time across projects and company operations, including internal and external compliance requirements.
- **Centralized reporting**: Report on time and work activity from a single TrackingTime account, even when time is tracked in Trello.
- **Multi-app workflows**: Sync TrackingTime with other tools your team uses so they can track time without constantly switching between apps.

## How It Works
1. **Sign up for TrackingTime.**
2. **Install the TrackingTime Time Tracker Power-Up in Trello.**
3. **Open your Trello boards and track time directly from your cards**, with all data sent to TrackingTime for timesheets and analytics.
