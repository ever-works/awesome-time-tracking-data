**Category:** Practices  
**Brand:** AICPA  
**Tags:** compliance, enterprise, privacy

### Overview
SSAE 18 is a set of attestation and auditing standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It defines a common framework for independent auditors to examine and report on a service organization’s controls related to handling sensitive client data.

It is the foundational standard used for SOC (System and Organization Controls) examinations and reports (SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3).

### Purpose
- Provide a standardized framework for evaluating and reporting on service organization controls.
- Enhance transparency and trust between service providers and their customers.
- Support business compliance, auditability, and risk management.
- Help organizations demonstrate appropriate controls over:
  - Security
  - Availability
  - Processing integrity
  - Confidentiality
  - Privacy

### Features / Scope
- **Controls over sensitive data**
  - Focuses on how service organizations process, store, and transmit client or customer data.
  - Applicable to environments such as cloud-based services, data centers, and outsourced business processes.

- **Foundation for SOC examinations**
  - Defines how auditors perform:
    - **SOC 1** engagements (controls relevant to financial reporting).
    - **SOC 2** engagements (controls over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, privacy).
    - **SOC 3** engagements (general-use reports based on SOC 2 criteria, for broad external audiences).

- **Report types (Type 1 vs. Type 2)**
  - **Type 1 report**
    - Describes the system and controls.
    - Evaluates the design and implementation of controls **as of a specific date** (point-in-time snapshot).
  - **Type 2 report**
    - Describes the system and controls.
    - Evaluates the operating effectiveness of controls **over a period of time** (typically several months).

- **Support for risk, compliance, and assurance needs**
  - Demonstrates that a service organization’s controls are independently assessed.
  - Helps user entities meet regulatory, audit, and internal governance requirements.
  - Supports disaster recovery and continuity expectations (e.g., backup and availability of critical data).

- **Relevance to time tracking and similar services**
  - For services like cloud-based time tracking and attendance systems, SSAE 18-based SOC reporting provides assurance that:
    - Employee time data is securely stored.
    - Data is properly backed up.
    - Services are reliably available.
    - Data handling supports compliance and auditability.

### Who It’s For (Typical Users / Applicable Organizations)
SSAE 18 is relevant for **service organizations** that process, store, or transmit sensitive data on behalf of others, including:

- **Financial institutions and their providers**
  - Banks, credit unions, insurance companies and their outsourced service providers.
  - Ensures integrity of financial information and protection of customer financial data.

- **Healthcare-related organizations and vendors**
  - Hospitals, clinics, medical practices, and their service providers.
  - Addresses protection of patient health information (PHI).

- **Technology and cloud service providers**
  - Cloud platforms, data centers, hosting providers.
  - Software developers and SaaS providers handling customer data.
  - Demonstrates data security and privacy controls.

- **Government agencies and contractors**
  - Agencies that outsource IT or business processes.
  - Contractors and vendors handling sensitive government information.

- **Retail and e‑commerce**
  - Organizations processing credit card payments.
  - Retailers storing or transmitting customer data and financial/transaction data.

- **Professional services firms**
  - Accounting, legal, and consulting firms dealing with sensitive client data.

Essentially, any organization that offers services involving sensitive or regulated data can use SSAE 18-based SOC reports to demonstrate the design and effectiveness of their controls.
