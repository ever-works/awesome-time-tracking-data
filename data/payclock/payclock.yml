description: PayClock is Lathem’s cloud-based employee time tracking and
  attendance system that lets staff clock in and out via web browser, mobile
  app, PCs, or connected Lathem time clocks. It centralizes timecard data for
  on-demand viewing, automates overtime and attendance calculations, and
  integrates with payroll platforms such as QuickBooks, ADP, Paychex, Gusto, and
  Sage. PayClock helps reduce time theft, control unauthorized overtime, and
  support ACA and wage/hour compliance for both on-site and remote teams.
