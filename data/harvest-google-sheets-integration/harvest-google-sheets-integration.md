### Overview
Harvest – Google Sheets Integration is a Zapier automation template that connects Harvest time tracking with Google Sheets. When a new time entry is created in Harvest, the workflow automatically inserts a corresponding row into a specified Google Sheets spreadsheet. This helps centralize time records, enable custom reporting, and maintain a backup of time logs without manual data entry.

### Features

  - Detects new time entries created in Harvest.  
  - Automatically adds each new entry as a row in a chosen Google Sheets spreadsheet.

- **Custom spreadsheet destination**

  - Supports organizing different teams, projects, or clients into separate sheets or tabs.

  - Aggregates time tracking information from Harvest into a single spreadsheet.  
  - Simplifies consolidation of time data across multiple projects or users.

- **Reporting and analysis ready**

- **Data backup and audit trail**  
  - Keeps an external copy of Harvest time entries in Google Sheets for backup.  
  - Facilitates auditing and historical review of time logs.

- **No manual data entry**  
  - Eliminates the need to export/import or copy-paste time entries from Harvest to Sheets.  
  - Reduces risk of human error in timesheets and reports.
