### Overview
Labor Burden Calculator is a free online tool that estimates the true hourly cost of an employee by combining their base wage with payroll taxes and insurance-related overhead. It is designed to help businesses (especially in construction) improve job costing and budgeting by revealing the full hourly labor burden for different labor classifications.

### Features
- **Total hourly labor cost estimation**  
  - Calculates the full hourly cost of an employee, not just their wage.

- **Labor burden breakdown**  
  - Separates base wage from additional burden costs to show:  
    - Total hourly cost  
    - Total hourly burden (over-and-above wage)

- **Tax components included (with default rates)**  
  - FICA (example default: 7.65%)  
  - FUTA (example default: 6.0%)  
  - SUTA (example mid-range example: 3.0%)  
  - Uses standard example rates for display; actual numbers can be adjusted with your own data.

- **Insurance cost components**  
  - General liability insurance rate per $1,000 of payroll.  
  - Worker’s compensation rate per $100 of payroll.  
  - Converts these rates into a per-hour dollar cost for each employee classification.

- **Supports multiple labor classifications**  
  - Allows you to repeat the calculation for different labor classes (e.g., different trade codes or risk classes) to see the cost per hour for each.

- **Step-by-step guided input**  
  - Enter hourly labor rate.  
  - Use General Liability and Worker’s Compensation declaration pages to find the correct class codes and rates.  
  - Input GL rate (per $1,000) and WC rate (per $100).  
  - View resulting per-hour cost and burden.  
  - Repeat for as many labor classifications as needed.

- **Visualization of hidden costs**  
  - Highlights that taxes and insurance add significant cost beyond the stated hourly wage.

- **Job costing & budgeting support**  
  - Intended to be used as a tool to improve accuracy of job bids and labor-related budgeting by incorporating full labor burden.

- **Review-ready outputs**  
  - Produces a detailed cost breakdown that can be reviewed with an accountant for refinement and validation.
