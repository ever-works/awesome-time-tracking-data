# PayClock

PayClock is Lathem’s cloud-based employee time tracking and attendance system that lets staff clock in and out via web browser, mobile app, PCs, or connected Lathem time clocks. It centralizes timecard data for on-demand viewing, automates overtime and attendance calculations, and integrates with payroll platforms such as QuickBooks, ADP, Paychex, Gusto, and Sage. PayClock helps reduce time theft, control unauthorized overtime, and support ACA and wage/hour compliance for both on-site and remote teams.
