## Overview
A practical tutorial showing how to turn Trello into a lightweight time-tracking system by connecting it with dedicated time-tracking tools via Zapier. It focuses on building workflows that log and visualize time spent on tasks and projects without native Trello time-tracking features.

## Key Concepts
- Trello does not include built-in time-tracking, but can be extended using integrations.
- Time tracking is handled by external apps (e.g., Toggl Track) while Trello remains the task/project hub.
- Zapier automations ("Zaps") connect Trello events and time-tracking events to keep data in sync.

## Features / What You’ll Learn
- **Connecting Trello to time-tracking apps**  
  - How to connect Trello to tools like Toggl Track using Zapier.  
  - Example: create a new Trello card whenever you start tracking a new task in Toggl Track.

- **Building automated workflows (Zaps)**  
  - Using Zapier’s no-code automation to link Trello and time-tracking apps.  
  - Trigger–action logic: events in a time tracker (e.g., starting a timer) can automatically create or update Trello cards.  
  - Option to create your own custom Zaps tailored to your board structure and time-tracking needs.

- **Multi-device time tracking via integration**  
  - Using a cross-platform time tracker (e.g., Toggl Track) that runs on many devices, then syncing its data with Trello.

- **Using Trello as a time-tracking front-end**  
  - Treating Trello boards and cards as the visual/organizational layer for tasks.  
  - Reliance on external time-tracking apps + Zapier for logging and aggregating time data behind the scenes.

## Typical Workflow Pattern (Implied)
- Start a timer in a time-tracking app (e.g., Toggl Track).  
- A Zap triggers and automatically creates or updates a Trello card representing that task.  
- Trello maintains the task context and status, while the time-tracking app holds detailed time logs.
