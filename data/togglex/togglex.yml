  # Togglex


  An Elixir wrapper for Toggl API v8 and the Toggl Reports API, allowing Elixir
  applications to integrate with Toggl’s time‑tracking and reporting
  capabilities.


  ## Features

  - Elixir wrapper around the official [Toggl
  API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs)

  - Supports Toggl API v8

  - Supports the Toggl Reports API for accessing reporting data

  - Provides a `Client` abstraction to handle authentication and perform API
  calls

  - Designed to integrate Toggl’s time-tracking and reporting features directly
  into Elixir applications

  - Implementation approach inspired by existing Elixir API clients (ExTracker,
  Tentacat), following familiar patterns for resource modules and client usage


  ## Technology

  - Language: Elixir

  - Distributed as a Mix package (addable via `mix.exs`)


  ## Integrations

  - Toggl (time tracking and reporting platform)


  ## Pricing

  - Open-source Elixir library hosted on GitHub

  - No license fee to use the library (Toggl account and Toggl’s own API
  terms/limits still apply)
