  # Notion Time Tracking (TrackingTime Integration)


  A browser extension–based integration that lets you track time directly from
  Notion pages and databases using TrackingTime, with automatic timesheets and
  analytics.


  ## Features

    - Start and stop timers from within your Notion workspace.  
    - Track time on documented work without leaving Notion.

  - **Browser extension support**

    - Adds time-tracking controls into Notion (and other supported web apps).

  - **Automatic timesheets**  
    - Time entries recorded through Notion are captured automatically in TrackingTime.  
    - Centralized tracking of work done in Notion for reporting and analysis.

  - **In-depth analytics**

    - Helps monitor work, comply with internal/external requirements, and support reporting.

  - **Works across devices**
