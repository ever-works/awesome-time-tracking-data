  ## busybusy Mobile Time Clock App


  ### Overview

  busybusy Mobile Time Clock App is a mobile time tracking solution that turns
  employees’ smartphones into time clocks for crews working in the field. It is
  geared toward construction and other field-based workforces that need to
  record time away from a traditional office or jobsite time clock.


  ### Features

  - **Mobile time clock on smartphones** – Uses employees’ smartphones as time
  clocks instead of fixed hardware.

  - **Clock in / clock out** – Employees can punch in and out directly from
  their mobile devices.

  - **Task switching** – Workers can switch between tasks during the day so time
  is tracked per activity.

  - **Field time submission** – Time can be recorded and submitted from anywhere
  in the field, not just from a central location.

  - **Crew-focused workflows** – Designed to support crews working on jobs
  outside the office, such as construction sites.
