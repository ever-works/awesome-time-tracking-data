  busybusy’s Equipment Time Tracking App is a mobile tool for construction

    - Pay period
    - Week

  - **Machine hours tracking** – Track and compare working hours vs. idle hours
  for each machine to understand utilization and underutilization.

  heavily used vs. underused equipment and support better resource allocation.

  - **Clock-out hour reminders** – Automatically remind operators to update
  machine hours when they clock out, helping keep records current.

  - **Centralized hour reminder setting** – Manage the operator hour-update
  reminder process with a single configuration setting.
