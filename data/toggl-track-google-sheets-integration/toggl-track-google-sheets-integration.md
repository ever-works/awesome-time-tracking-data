### Overview
Toggl Track – Google Sheets Integration is an automation (via Zapier) that records every new Toggl Track time entry as a separate row in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It provides a structured, real‑time timesheet for tracking work hours, analyzing time usage, and eliminating manual copy‑paste between Toggl Track and Sheets.

### Features
- **Automatic time-entry logging**  
  - Every new time entry created in Toggl Track is automatically added as a new row in a connected Google Sheets spreadsheet.

- **Structured timesheet creation**  
  - Builds a consistent, tabular log of work, suitable for reporting, invoicing, or internal tracking.  
  - Can be used as a live timesheet that updates as you track time.

- **Real-time data sync**  
  - New entries appear in Google Sheets shortly after they are created in Toggl Track, keeping timesheets up to date.

- **Error reduction vs. manual entry**  
  - Reduces risk of typos and missed entries compared to manually copying time data into spreadsheets.

- **Support for time analysis and reporting**  
  - Data in Sheets can be filtered, grouped, or graphed for analyzing time usage by client, project, task, or tag (depending on what you configure in the Zap).  
  - Enables custom reports, dashboards, or pivot tables based on Toggl Track data.

- **Improved workflow efficiency**  
  - Removes repetitive data entry from timesheet and reporting workflows.  
  - Helps maintain more precise and consistent records for billing, payroll, or productivity analysis.

### Triggers (from Toggl Track side)
While the page content mainly describes Google Gemini + Toggl, standard Toggl triggers relevant to timesheet workflows include:
- **New Client** – can trigger sheet updates or separate logs per client.  
- **New Project** – allows tracking or listing projects as they’re created.  
- **New Tag** – track or catalog new tags used for classification.  
- **New Task** – log or manage tasks as they appear.

(Actual column mapping and which fields from Toggl Track are written to Google Sheets are determined during setup in Zapier.)

### Pricing
No specific pricing details for this integration are provided in the available content. Access may depend on your Toggl Track plan, Google account, and Zapier (or Appy Pie Automate) subscription tier.
