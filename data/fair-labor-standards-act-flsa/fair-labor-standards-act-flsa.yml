name: Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
description: The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a U.S. federal law that sets
  minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards. For
  time tracking, it defines how working hours and overtime must be recorded and
  paid, making accurate, auditable time and attendance tracking systems
  essential for compliance. Time tracking tools used in U.S. organizations must
  support reliable capture of hours worked, visibility into overtime, and
  long-term retention of editable history to satisfy FLSA requirements and
  reduce risk of non-compliance and payroll disputes.

  ## Overview

  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a U.S. federal law that establishes
  nationwide standards for:

  - Minimum wage

  - Overtime pay

  - Recordkeeping

  - Youth (child) labor


  For organizations operating in the United States, FLSA compliance is central
  to payroll, scheduling, and time-and-attendance processes.


  ## Key Provisions

  - **Minimum wage**  
    - Sets a federal minimum hourly wage for covered, non‑exempt employees.  
    - States or localities may set higher minimum wages; employers must pay the highest applicable rate.

  - **Overtime pay**  
    - Requires overtime pay at **not less than 1.5 times the regular rate of pay** for all hours worked over **40 in a workweek** for covered, non‑exempt employees.  
    - Defines what counts as hours worked for overtime (e.g., certain training, travel, and on‑call time, depending on circumstances).

  - **Recordkeeping**  
    - Requires employers to maintain accurate records of hours worked and wages paid for covered employees.  
    - Specifies what information must be recorded (e.g., employee identifying data, hours each day and each workweek, total earnings, deductions, overtime earnings).  
    - Records must be retained for prescribed periods and be available for inspection by the Department of Labor.

  - **Youth employment (child labor)**  
    - Sets minimum age standards for employment and restricts the types of jobs and hours that minors may work.  
    - Includes additional protections for work that may be hazardous.

  - **Exempt vs. non‑exempt status**  
    - Defines categories of employees who are **exempt** from overtime (and sometimes minimum wage) requirements, often based on job duties and salary level (e.g., certain executive, administrative, professional, and outside sales roles).  
    - Non‑exempt employees are fully covered by minimum wage and overtime provisions.

  - **Coverage**  
    - Applies to most private and public sector employers in the U.S., including enterprises engaged in interstate commerce and certain individual employees.  
    - Includes special provisions for specific industries and job types (e.g., agriculture, government contracts, tipped employees, workers with disabilities under certain certificates).

  - **Enforcement and penalties**  
    - Enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD).  
    - Employees can file complaints; WHD may investigate employers, recover back wages, and pursue civil money penalties for violations.  
    - Allows for private lawsuits in some circumstances.

  ## Features (for HR, Payroll, and Time Tracking Practices)

  - **Defined minimum wage standard** to configure base pay rules.  

  - **Overtime calculation rules** (time‑and‑a‑half after 40 hours in a workweek
  for non‑exempt employees).  

  - **Clear workweek definition requirement** to structure scheduling and pay
  periods consistently.  

  - **Mandatory time and pay records** (hours per day, hours per week, total
  earnings, overtime, deductions).  

  - **Long‑term record retention requirements** for time and pay data.  

  - **Youth employment limits** that impact scheduling and role assignments for
  minors.  

  - **Exemption criteria** that determine which employees must track time for
  overtime versus those paid on a salary basis without overtime.  

  - **Auditability expectations** so employers can demonstrate compliance in the
  event of a DOL investigation or dispute.  

  - **Remedies for underpayment** (back wages and damages), shaping internal
  audit and correction workflows.


  ## Implications for Time & Attendance Systems

  - Must support **accurate capture of all hours worked** (including regular and
  overtime).  

  - Should provide **clear visibility into overtime** at the employee and
  organizational level.  

  - Need to maintain an **editable but auditable history** of time records and
  pay calculations, with change logs.  

  - Should support **configurable workweeks**, pay rates, and overtime rules
  aligned with FLSA and any stricter state/local laws.  

  - Must facilitate **records retention** for the durations required by FLSA and
  related regulations.  

  - Should allow for **reporting and exports** suitable for internal audits and
  potential DOL investigations.
