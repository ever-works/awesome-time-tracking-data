  ### Overview

  Harvest – Google Sheets Integration is a Zapier automation template that
  connects Harvest time tracking with Google Sheets. When a new time entry is
  created in Harvest, the workflow automatically inserts a corresponding row
  into a specified Google Sheets spreadsheet. This helps centralize time
  records, enable custom reporting, and maintain a backup of time logs without
  manual data entry.


  ### Features

  - **Automatic time entry logging**  
    - Detects new time entries created in Harvest.  
    - Automatically adds each new entry as a row in a chosen Google Sheets spreadsheet.

  - **Custom spreadsheet destination**  
    - Lets you choose which Google Sheets file and worksheet receive new time entries.  
    - Supports organizing different teams, projects, or clients into separate sheets or tabs.

  - **Centralized time tracking data**  
    - Aggregates time tracking information from Harvest into a single spreadsheet.  
    - Simplifies consolidation of time data across multiple projects or users.

  - **Reporting and analysis ready**  
    - Stores time logs in a spreadsheet format suited for filters, pivot tables, and charts.  
    - Enables building custom reports (e.g., by client, project, user, or date range).

  - **Data backup and audit trail**  
    - Keeps an external copy of Harvest time entries in Google Sheets for backup.  
    - Facilitates auditing and historical review of time logs.

  - **No manual data entry**  
    - Eliminates the need to export/import or copy-paste time entries from Harvest to Sheets.  
    - Reduces risk of human error in timesheets and reports.

  - **Automation via Zapier**  
    - Uses Zapier’s workflow engine to connect Harvest and Google Sheets.  
    - Can be extended with additional Zapier steps (e.g., filters, formatting, notifications) if configured within Zapier.

  ### Typical Use Cases

  - Building custom timesheet dashboards for teams or clients.  

  - Preparing data for billing, invoicing, or payroll workflows.  

  - Maintaining an always-updated spreadsheet archive of all Harvest time
  entries.
