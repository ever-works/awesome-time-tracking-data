  # Reports and Analyses (Kimai)


  **Category:** Web-based time tracking  

  **Brand:** Kimai  

  **Source:** https://www.kimai.org/documentation/reporting.html


  ## Overview

  The *Reports and Analyses* module in Kimai provides analytical views over
  recorded time entries. It allows users (with appropriate permissions) to break
  down tracked time by user, time period, and project, and to view aggregated,
  rounded data that is also used in invoices and exports.


  ## Features


  ### Permissions & Access Control

  - Access to reporting via the `view_reporting` permission.

  - Reports use rounded time data (consistent with invoices and exports).

  - Permissions affecting reporting views:
    - `view_other_timesheet`: enables choosing other users in reports.
    - `view_other_reporting`: allows seeing reports that include other users.
    - `view_all_data`: allows viewing data of all users (otherwise limited to team members).
  - When `view_other_timesheet` is granted:
    - The displayed username is replaced with a user selection box.
    - Available users to choose from are:
      - All users (if `view_all_data` is granted), or
      - Team members (if the current user is a team leader).

  ### User Visibility / Reporting FAQ

  - Reasons a user may not appear in reports:
    - The current user is not allowed to see that user’s data (permissions restriction).
    - The target user account is **deactivated**:
      - The user will not appear in the dropdown selection.
      - Existing time data for that user is still reported for selected periods.
    - The target user account is flagged as **System-Account**:
      - This flag can be checked in the user profile.
      - Users cannot set these flags for their own account.
