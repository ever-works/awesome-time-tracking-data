**Website:** https://zapier.com/

Zapier is an automation and AI orchestration platform that connects thousands of apps and services so you can automate workflows. While it’s not a standalone time tracking tool, it’s commonly used to build automated time tracking and reporting flows by integrating dedicated time tracking apps with project management, communication, and invoicing systems.

### Key Use Cases for Time Tracking
- Automatically log hours from one app into another (e.g., from time tracker to project management or spreadsheets).
- Sync timesheets between different tools used by operations, finance, and HR.
- Trigger actions based on time entries (e.g., send reminders, create invoices, update project status, notify managers).
- Centralize time-tracking data from multiple tools into a single reporting system.
- Use AI to summarize, categorize, or interpret logged time (e.g., summarize time logs by project or client).
